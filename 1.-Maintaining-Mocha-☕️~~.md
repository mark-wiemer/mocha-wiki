This page acts as a hub for anything that might be of interest to Mocha maintainers!

New sections can be added to this page, but should be refactored out in case they become large~~.

Are you a maintainer? Please sign yourself up for the ReleaseMug™ queue!

> A cyclic list with all the maintainers. The maintainer at the front of the queue holds the ReleaseMug™ (☕️), and must perform releases as needed. At the end of the period (2 weeks), the maintainer will move to the back of the queue, and will pass the ReleaseMug™ to the now-front-of-queue maintainer. Before passing the ReleaseMug™, a release _must_ be performed if there are any withstanding non-release changes in `master`.
