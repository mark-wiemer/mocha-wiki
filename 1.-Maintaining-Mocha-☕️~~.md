ヾ(๑╹◡╹)ﾉ Hi! こんにちは！

This page acts as a hub for anything that might be of interest to Mocha maintainers!

New sections can be added to this page, but should be refactored out in case they become large~~.

Are you a maintainer? Please sign yourself up for the ReleaseMug™ queue!

> The maintainer at the front of the queue holds the ReleaseMug™ (☕️), and must perform releases as needed. At the end of the period (1 week), the maintainer will move to the back of the queue, and will pass the ReleaseMug™ to the now-front-of-queue maintainer.

> Before passing the ReleaseMug™, a release _must_ be performed if there are any withstanding non-release changes in `master`. This helps making maintainers used to the release process, and maintaining a healthy release cycle.

# Release Process

1. Work on a new branch `release-draft`. Good for sharing progress with others, check how the `CHANGELOG`/Markdown looks, etc.
2. Manually craft `CHANGELOG.md` (hoping to automate this soon). Check all the merge commits and direct commits to `master` since the last release.
3. `npm version <major|minor|patch> --git-tag-version -m ":ship: Release v%s"`. This automatically re-generates `mocha.js`, runs the test suite locally, bumps `package.json` version, and adds a tag.
4. `npm publish` 🙌 
5. `git push origin master --tags`. Go to https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/tags and click `Add release notes` for your tag. Copy and paste your crafted `CHANGELOG.md` section.
6. Notify relevant Issues/PRs about changes having been released in version X. Ideally this would be automated. [e.g.](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/2434#issuecomment-296592181)
7. Refresh Issues page during a couple of hours (?)
